# Hospital_Database_Management_System_SQL_Project

### Hospital Database Management System project demonstrates various SQL queries designed for a Hospital Management System (HMS) database containing 100,000+ patient records and associated hospital data. The queries extract meaningful insights from the data, focusing on hospital operations, patient management, and billing. Key queries include:

* Average patient admissions (weekly, monthly, yearly) per hospital.
* Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly hospital occupancy rates.
* Patient categorization by age (Child, Adult, Senior).
* Identification of the most consumed medicine, including by diagnosis.
* Calculation of average hospitalization days.
* Monthly and yearly income analysis, including cash/credit payment breakdowns.
### These queries efficiently handle large datasets using techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), JOIN operations, and window functions for data aggregation and analysis.
